# Next Supa Type

## An easy, performant, typesafe stack

Stack:

- Next.js: Server-side rendering, performant and improves SEO by allowing google to crawl more effectively
- Supabase: an open-source, Postgres db competitor to Firebase.
- Typescript: Type-safe version of JavaScript to help eliminate errors, bringing the benefits of a static language (over a dynamic one e.g. python).
